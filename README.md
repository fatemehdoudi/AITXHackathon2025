**Agentic AI for Healthcare Provider Matching**

This repository contains two main components:
- **agents_mobile_app/** — Mobile application interface for interacting with the AI agent system.
- **agents_cli/** — Command-line interface for running simple tests or lightweight agent interactions.

Both parts share the same Python environment and dependencies.
