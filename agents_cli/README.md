# Agents CLI

This is the command-line interface (CLI) for the **Agentic AI Healthcare Provider Matching** project.

The CLI provides a simple way to test the provider matching logic and agent reasoning without using the mobile app.  
Currently, the system supports **BCBS insurance** only.

---

## ðŸš€ Run the CLI

To run the CLI interface:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will start the LLM reasoning agent built with **NVIDIA Nemotron**, which handles provider matching and selection.
